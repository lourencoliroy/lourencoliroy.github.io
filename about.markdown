<p style="text-align:right;">
I am probably most accurately described as a communications engineer. I am currently
completing a PhD at the University of Sydney with a background in Network Engineering
and Digital Music Technology. My area of expertise is digital signal processing and
my research is in radio frequency interference mitigation using Phased Array Feeds
on the Australian SKA Pathfinder and Parkes telescopes.

I am also an educator, teaching Humanitarian Engineering and astronomy.
