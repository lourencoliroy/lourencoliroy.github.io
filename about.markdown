<p style="text-align:right;">
I am probably most accurately described as a communications engineer. I work at
in the Signal Processing Technologies group at CSIRO's Astronomy and Space Science.
I am currently completing a PhD at the University of Sydney with a background in
Network Engineering and Digital Music Technology. My research is in radio frequency
interference mitigation using Phased Array Feeds on the Australian SKA Pathfinder
and Parkes telescopes.

I am also an educator, teaching Astronomy and Humanitarian Engineering at the University
of Sydney and the University of Technology Sydney respectively.
